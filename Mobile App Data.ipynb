    "# Profitable App Profiles for App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets and enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-apps ads. This means that our revenue for any given apps is mostly influenced by the number of users use our apps. Our goal of this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are more likely to attract more customers from 10,000 Android Apps and 7,000 iOS apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Opening and Exploring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. \n",

    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over four million apps requires a signnificant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid speading resources to collect new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, there are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",
    "-  A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from this link.\n",
    "-  A data set containing data about approximately seven thousand 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from this link.\n",
